# Singleton Pattern

## What is it?
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of a database connection:
- You want to avoid multiple connections to the same database
- Everyone in the application shares the same connection
- Similar to how an office might share one network printer

## Folder Structure
```
singleton/
├── interfaces/
│   └── DatabaseConnection.ts    # Interface definition
├── config/
│   └── DatabaseConfig.ts        # Configuration types
├── database/
│   └── DatabaseConnectionManager.ts  # Main singleton implementation
├── index.ts                     # Main exports
├── examples/
│   └── index.ts                # Usage examples
└── README.md                   # Documentation
```

## Our Example: Database Connection Manager

### The Problem
Managing database connections presents several challenges:
- Creating new connections is resource-intensive
- Multiple connections can lead to resource waste
- Connection state needs to be consistent across the application

### The Solution
```typescript
// Get the database connection (always returns the same instance)
const db = DatabaseConnectionManager.getInstance();
db.connect();
```

### Benefits
1. **Single Instance**: Guarantees one connection throughout the application
2. **Global Access**: Easily accessible from any part of the code
3. **Controlled Creation**: Prevents unauthorized instance creation
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Creates the instance only when needed

### When to Use It
- When exactly one instance of a class is needed
- When strict control over global state is required
- When you need to avoid redundant resource creation
